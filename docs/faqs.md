## What is Event Sourcing?
Event sourcing is a technique used in software engineering to track the changes to a system's state by storing a log of events rather than the current state itself. This allows for a more detailed and accurate representation of the system's history, and enables easier reconstruction and replay of past events.

Event sourcing is often used in situations where a high level of accuracy and audibility is required, such as in financial systems, where transactions and changes need to be tracked and recorded with precision. It is also commonly used in systems that involve complex data transformations or multiple sources of input, as it allows for easier tracking and debugging of changes. Additionally, event sourcing can be useful in distributed systems, where it can help ensure consistency and reliability of data across multiple nodes.

## What is CQRS?
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is an architectural pattern that separates the responsibilities of querying data (reading) and modifying data (writing) in a system. This pattern is used to improve the scalability, performance, and maintainability of a system by allowing different components to focus on their specific tasks without interfering with each other. In a CQRS system, a command-side component is responsible for handling all requests to modify data, while a query-side component is responsible for handling all requests to read data. This separation of responsibilities allows for more efficient and effective handling of data, as well as a more modular and scalable architecture.

## How are Event Sourcing and CQRS related?
Event sourcing and CQRS are related in that they are both architectural patterns that are often used together to improve the performance, scalability, and maintainability of a system. Event sourcing is a pattern that focuses on storing all events that occur within a system in an event log, allowing organizations to track and audit every change that has been made to the system. CQRS is a pattern that separates the responsibilities of querying data and modifying data in a system, allowing for more efficient and effective handling of data. When used together, event sourcing and CQRS can provide a comprehensive and transparent record of all actions and decisions made within a system, as well as a more modular and scalable architecture.

## What is an Event in the context of Event Sourcing?
In the context of event sourcing, an event is a record of a specific change or action that has occurred within a system. An event typically includes information about the type of change or action that occurred, as well as any relevant data or details associated with the event. Events are used in event sourcing to create a complete and accurate record of all changes and actions that have occurred within a system, allowing organizations to track and audit every change that has been made to the system. By storing events in an event log, it is possible to recreate the current state of an entity or concept within a system at any point in time, as well as to analyze and understand the data within the system.

## What is an Aggregate in the context of Event Sourcing?
In the context of event sourcing, an aggregate is a collection of events that are related to a specific entity or concept within a system. An aggregate is typically defined by a specific set of rules or constraints that determine the types of events that can be included in the aggregate, as well as the order in which they must be applied. Aggregates are used in event sourcing to group related events together, allowing for more efficient and effective handling of data within a system. By organizing events into aggregates, it is easier to recreate the current state of an entity or concept within a system, as well as to audit and track changes that have been made over time.

## What is a Projection in the context of Event Sourcing?
In the context of event sourcing, a projection is a representation of the current state of an entity or concept within a system based on the events that have occurred within the system. A projection is typically created by applying the events in an aggregate to a specific template or model, which defines the structure and content of the projection. Projections are used in event sourcing to provide a more easily accessible and understandable view of the data within a system, allowing for easier querying and analysis of the data. By providing projections of the current state of entities or concepts within a system, it is possible to quickly and easily access and analyze the most up-to-date information within the system.
